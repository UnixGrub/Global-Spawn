# Global-Spawn
A script to set the global map spawn point for your players. Had multiple fuckers asking for it, so here it is.

#NOTE
This script supports multiple spawn points

#INSTALLATION
- To install, simply drag and drop directly into your servers addons folder.

#CONFIGURATION
- Open the file with your favourite text editor. Sublime, Notepad++, Atom... etc
- Change the "locAmount" to a number which represents the amount of spawn points you want.
- Get your spawn vectors by typing "getpos" in the console of your server.
- Paste that vector between the location table. There are some examples to assist you.
- DONE!

#IMPORTANT
- Ensure you set the "locAmount" value according to the amount of locations set. If the number is lower then the set spawn locations, then it will not work correctly.

This is very simple to follow. If you cannot follow this guide, then get the fuck off github and remove your server!
